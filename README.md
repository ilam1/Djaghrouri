### Description
This is a multiplayer game of Jeopardy with our own unique twists coded in Java. The user is prompted to either make their own game, or to choose from a list of pre-given categories to play from. From there on, the player is able to choose between Normal or Special Edition Jeopardy, and then compete with others for the most amount of points. At the end, All or Nothing! or Bet! is invoked to determine the winner.

### Jargon Explained
* Special Edition Jeopardy randomly enhances certain boxes with a chance for player(s) to double the amount of money they win (similar to Double Jeopardy), except failure comes with a randomly generated twist, losing double thier amount.
* Normal Jeopardy fills x location(s) with Double Jeopardy, and follows the regular format for Jeopardy.
